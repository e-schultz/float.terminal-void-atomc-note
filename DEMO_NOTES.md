# FLOAT.terminal // Demo Presentation Notes

## 1. The Problem: "The Blank Page"
*   Traditional text editors (Word, Google Docs) are linear and rigid.
*   They don't match how we actually think: in fragments, threads, and connections.
*   Technical workflows (coding, system design) require switching between "Writing" and "Querying" data.

## 2. The Solution: FLOAT.terminal
*   **What is it?** A "Cyberpunk Note-Taking Environment" that treats your notes like code.
*   **The Vibe:** It looks like a terminal from a sci-fi movie. This isn't just for style—the high-contrast, distraction-free "Void" helps with deep focus (neurodivergent-friendly design).

## 3. Key Features (The "Wow" Factor)

### A. Atomic Blocks & Threading
*   *Demo:* Show typing a thought, then pressing a button to "Thread" underneath it.
*   *Value:* We aren't writing a document; we are building a tree of thoughts.

### B. The System Context (Sidebar)
*   *Demo:* Point to the right sidebar. This is the "Brain" of the project.
*   *Action:* Click a node (e.g., "Initial Input Event").
*   *Result:* Watch it instantly appear in the main editor.
*   *Value:* You never lose context. Your previous work is always one click away from your current workspace.

### C. "Fuzzy" Querying (The Magic)
*   *Demo:* Create a **Query Block**. Type something lazy like: `query { find all tags called "core" }`.
*   *Action:* Click **EXECUTE**.
*   *Result:* The block pulses (loading), then returns actual JSON data.
*   *Value:* We integrated AI (Google Gemini) not to write for you, but to *retrieve* for you. It turns your notebook into a database.

## 4. Why This Matters
FLOAT.terminal blurs the line between **Thinking** and **Coding**. It’s a tool for architects, designers, and developers who need to manage complex systems without leaving their flow state.
